Intro to workshop (15 min)
Intro to modeling - workflow and tools being used for real-time control (15min)

How are we approaching real-time control of stormwater systems?
 - Observer the state of the system
	 - State being the water levels, flows, and other inputs of interest
	 - Controller and determine which action to take
	 - Implement the action 
	 - There are multiple varients of this approach, where we can control in different frequencies etc.
- In simulation relm, we do the same thing.
	- Gets the rain and other things runs through the simulation 
	- Run the simulation for a couple of steps, pause it, get the state, determine the best actions, and progress the simulation
- Stack:
- pyswmm
What is pyswmm? and what does it do?
What is pystorms and what does it do?
	- How does pystorms abstract the problem of real-time control in stormwater systems?
	- What is a scenario
	- What are the things in a scenario
		- performance metric
	- easy to use API 
In this talk, we will be using pystorms. We will also give an example on how to use pyswmm for controlling stormwater system so you can use it for your needs.

The first notebook would show how you would control things using pyswmm and then we will go and show how you can use pystorms to control stormwater systems.
