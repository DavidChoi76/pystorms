Scenario Theta
==============

This synthetic scenario is designed to be a unit test for control
algorithms. Two basins in this scenario are idealized to be rectangular
with a capacity of :math:`1000m^3`.
Outlets in the basins are at the bottom and have a dimension of :math:`1m^2`
and their percent of opening can be controlled during the duration of
the storm.

Objective
---------

Maintain the flow of water at the outlet of the stormwater network below :math:`0.5 m^3s^{-1}`.
The degree of success or failure of the algorithm to achieve the objective is computed based on the following metric.

State-action space
------------------

States
~~~~~~

Water levels (:math:`m`) in the two basins at every step, indexed by the order of the basin are
defined as the states in this scenario. For example,

Actions
~~~~~~~

Percent of valve opening :math:`[0,1]` are defined as the actions in the network.
