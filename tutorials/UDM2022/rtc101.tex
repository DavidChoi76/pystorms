\section{Urban water systems}

% What are urban water systems?
urban drinage systems are networks of links and nodes that convey water in urban environments.

classically these systems are developed as built as a static infrastructure or with someform of localized control.
but given that changes that we are seeing in the environment around us, our infrastructure is having trouble catching up with it.

sensing and communication enable us to monitor the system in near-real time and we can operate them to use these systems to fullest of their ability. 

these networks can be classified into three:
\begin{itemize}
	\item storm water networks
	\item drinking water networks
	\item sanitary systems
\end{itemize}
through these systems can all be controlled, in this session we focus on the storm water systems.

\section{Control of water systems}
Control of water networks is by no means new, its has been going on since the beginning of time.
