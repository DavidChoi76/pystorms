Scenario Theta
==============

This scenario was created to serve as a unit test for control algorithms.
In this scenario, two idealized basins (in parallel) of :math:`1000m^3` are draining into a downstream water body. 
Outlets in the basins (:math:`1m^2`) are at the bottom and can be controlled throughout the duration of the simulation.

Objective
---------

Maintain the flow of water at the outlet of the stormwater network below :math:`0.5 m^3s^{-1}`.
The degree of success or failure of the algorithm to achieve the objective is computed based on the following metric.

States
~~~~~~

Water levels (:math:`m`) in the two basins at every step, indexed by the order of the basin are
defined as the states in this scenario.

Control actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Percent of valve opening :math:`[0,1]` at the outlet of each basin.
